      "code": "Several ways exist to print \"Factorial of a given number\" in Python. Here are a few, ranging from simple printing to a more complete factorial calculation:\n\n**Method 1: Simple Print Statement**\n\nThis method simply prints the string.  It doesn't calculate the factorial.\n\n```python\nprint(\"Factorial of a given number\") \n```\n\n**Method 2: Print Statement with User Input and Factorial Calculation (using iterative approach)**\n\nThis version prompts the user for a number and calculates the factorial iteratively.\n\n```python\ndef factorial_iterative(n):\n  \"\"\"Calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer iteratively.\"\"\"\n  if n < 0:\n    return \"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\"\n  elif n == 0:\n    return 1\n  else:\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n      result *= i\n    return result\n\nnumber = int(input(\"Enter a non-negative integer: \"))\nfactorial = factorial_iterative(number)\nprint(f\"Factorial of {number} is: {factorial}\")\n```\n\n**Method 3: Print Statement with User Input and Factorial Calculation (using recursive approach)**\n\nThis version uses recursion to calculate the factorial.  Recursion can be less efficient for very large numbers.\n\n```python\ndef factorial_recursive(n):\n  \"\"\"Calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer recursively.\"\"\"\n  if n < 0:\n    return \"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\"\n  elif n == 0:\n    return 1\n  else:\n    return n * factorial_recursive(n - 1)\n\nnumber = int(input(\"Enter a non-negative integer: \"))\nfactorial = factorial_recursive(number)\nprint(f\"Factorial of {number} is: {factorial}\")\n\n```\n\nChoose the method that best suits your needs.  If you just need to print the phrase, Method 1 is sufficient. If you need the actual factorial calculation, Method 2 or 3 provide that functionality.  Method 2 (iterative) is generally preferred for its efficiency, especially with larger numbers.",
