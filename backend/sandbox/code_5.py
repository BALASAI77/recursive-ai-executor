The previous code likely timed out because it used an inefficient primality test.  Here are two improved versions: one optimized for smaller numbers and one using the Miller-Rabin test for larger numbers (probabilistic, but very fast and accurate).

**Version 1: Optimized for smaller numbers**

This version is efficient for numbers up to a few million.  It avoids unnecessary checks by only testing divisibility up to the square root of the number.

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    """Checks if n is a prime number.  Efficient for smaller numbers."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

# Example usage
number = 1000003  # A large prime number
print(f"Is {number} a prime number? {is_prime(number)}")

number = 1000004  # An even number
print(f"Is {number} a prime number? {is_prime(number)}")

number = 1
print(f"Is {number} a prime number? {is_prime(number)}")

number = 2
print(f"Is {number} a prime number? {is_prime(number)}")

number = 3
print(f"Is {number} a prime number? {is_prime(number)}")

number = 4
print(f"Is {number} a prime number? {is_prime(number)}")

```


**Version 2: Miller-Rabin primality test (for larger numbers)**

The Miller-Rabin test is a probabilistic test, meaning there's a tiny chance it could return an incorrect result. However, the probability of error is extremely low, especially with multiple iterations.  This is much faster than deterministic tests for very large numbers.

```python
import random

def miller_rabin(n, k=40):  # k is the number of iterations (higher k = higher accuracy)
    """Miller-Rabin primality test.  Efficient for large numbers."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False

    r, s = 0, n - 1
    while s % 2 == 0:
        r += 1
        s //= 2

    for _ in range(k):
        a = random.randrange(2, n - 1)
        x = pow(a, s, n)
        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:
            continue
        for _ in range(r - 1):
            x = pow(x, 2, n)
            if x == n - 1:
                break
        else:
            return False
    return True

# Example usage
number = 1000000007 #A large prime number
print(f"Is {number} a prime number? {miller_rabin(number)}")

number = 1000000008 #A large composite number
print(f"Is {number} a prime number? {miller_rabin(number)}")
```

Choose the version that best suits your needs based on the size of the numbers you'll be testing.  For most everyday purposes, Version 1 is sufficient.  For cryptographic applications or very large numbers, Version 2 is necessary. Remember that  `miller_rabin` is probabilistic, while `is_prime` is deterministic.
