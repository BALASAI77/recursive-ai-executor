Here are a few options, with varying levels of optimization:\n\n**Option 1: Basic (Inefficient for large numbers)**\n\nThis approach checks divisibility from 2 up to `n-1`.  It's simple but slow for large numbers.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime_basic(n):\n  \"\"\"Checks if a number is prime (basic, inefficient for large n).\"\"\"\n  if n <= 1:\n    return False\n  for i in range(2, n):\n    if n % i == 0:\n      return False\n  return True\n\n# Example usage\nprint(is_prime_basic(2))   # True\nprint(is_prime_basic(15))  # False\nprint(is_prime_basic(97))  # True\n```\n\n**Option 2: Optimized (Checks up to the square root)**\n\nA significant optimization:  We only need to check divisibility up to the square root of `n`. If a number has a divisor greater than its square root, it must also have a divisor smaller than its square root.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime_optimized(n):\n  \"\"\"Checks if a number is prime (optimized).\"\"\"\n  if n <= 1:\n    return False\n  if n == 2:\n    return True\n  if n % 2 == 0:\n    return False\n  for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):  # Only odd numbers\n    if n % i == 0:\n      return False\n  return True\n\n# Example usage\nprint(is_prime_optimized(2))   # True\nprint(is_prime_optimized(15))  # False\nprint(is_prime_optimized(97))  # True\nprint(is_prime_optimized(1000000007)) #True (much faster than basic for large numbers)\n\n```\n\n**Option 3: Using the `sympy` library (for very large numbers)**\n\nFor extremely large numbers, the `sympy` library provides highly optimized primality testing functions.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef is_prime_sympy(n):\n  \"\"\"Checks if a number is prime using the sympy library.\"\"\"\n  return sympy.isprime(n)\n\n# Example usage\nprint(is_prime_sympy(2))   # True\nprint(is_prime_sympy(15))  # False\nprint(is_prime_sympy(97))  # True\nprint(is_prime_sympy(1000000007)) #True (very fast for even extremely large numbers)\n\n```\n\nChoose the option that best suits your needs.  For most everyday purposes, `is_prime_optimized` provides a good balance of speed and simplicity.  For extremely large numbers, use `is_prime_sympy`.  Avoid `is_prime_basic` unless you're dealing with very small numbers, due to its poor performance for larger inputs.",
