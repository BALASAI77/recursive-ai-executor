Several versions are provided below to check for primality, addressing different needs and potential error sources.

**Version 1: Basic Primality Test (Efficient for smaller numbers)**

This version is straightforward and easy to understand. It's efficient for smaller numbers but becomes slow for very large numbers.

```python
def is_prime_basic(n):
    """Checks if a number is prime using a basic algorithm.

    Args:
      n: The number to check.

    Returns:
      True if n is prime, False otherwise.  Returns False for n <= 1.
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

#Example usage
number = 17
if is_prime_basic(number):
    print(f"{number} is a prime number")
else:
    print(f"{number} is not a prime number")

number = 20
if is_prime_basic(number):
    print(f"{number} is a prime number")
else:
    print(f"{number} is not a prime number")

```

**Version 2: Miller-Rabin Primality Test (Probabilistic, efficient for large numbers)**

The Miller-Rabin test is a probabilistic primality test.  It's much faster for large numbers than the basic test, but there's a tiny probability it could incorrectly identify a composite number as prime.  The probability of error decreases with the number of iterations.

```python
import random

def is_prime_miller_rabin(n, k=5):  # k is the number of iterations
    """Checks if a number is prime using the Miller-Rabin algorithm.

    Args:
      n: The number to check.
      k: The number of iterations (higher k reduces the probability of error).

    Returns:
      True if n is probably prime, False otherwise. Returns False for n <= 1.
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False

    r, s = 0, n - 1
    while s % 2 == 0:
        r += 1
        s //= 2

    for _ in range(k):
        a = random.randrange(2, n - 1)
        x = pow(a, s, n)
        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:
            continue
        for _ in range(r - 1):
            x = pow(x, 2, n)
            if x == n - 1:
                break
        else:
            return False  # Composite
    return True  # Probably prime


# Example Usage
number = 1000000007 #Large prime number example
if is_prime_miller_rabin(number):
    print(f"{number} is probably a prime number")
else:
    print(f"{number} is not a prime number")

number = 1000000008 #Example of a composite number
if is_prime_miller_rabin(number):
    print(f"{number} is probably a prime number")
else:
    print(f"{number} is not a prime number")
```

Choose the version that best suits your needs. For smaller numbers (up to a few million), Version 1 is generally sufficient. For larger numbers where speed is paramount and a tiny probability of error is acceptable, Version 2 (Miller-Rabin) is far superior.  Remember that the `random` module is a standard Python library and should already be installed.  No additional installation is needed.
